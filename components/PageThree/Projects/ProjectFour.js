                                    My first personal project, and what better
                                    way to start my coding journey than with a
                                    childhood favourite? Two weeks into the
                                    Bootcamp, we were introduced to the Pok√©mon
                                    API and the rest was history. I wanted to
                                    refactor the code (it's not even responsive)
                                    but I decided not to change the code to
                                    remind myself where I started.
